            @{{ author }}, great progress! I have assigned this issue and labeled it. Now it is your turn to give us the assets details.
            Let's start with the emails: please type the command "/campaign-email" to start giving us the details for the email build.
            **Pro-tip:** Type it as many times as necessary according to the number of emails required for this campaign
            **Pro-tip II:** Please type the command otherwise it won't work. Yep, copy and paste won't do it unfortunately.
