            Single Emails are straight forward and I believe we already have all that is needed to work on it for you. 
            
            In case of any additional questions someone from the team will get in touch.
            
            Thank you!

            If these are leads from a Webinar that we worked on together, we would ask you to go to that issue and follow the instructions there. 
            
            If this Lead Upload doesn't come from a Webinar that we worked on together you are in the right place and we will pick it up from here :smile:
            
            Thank you!
