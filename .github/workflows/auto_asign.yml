            ðŸ‘‹ @{{ author }}, this is the MOPs bot. Thank you for raising an issue!
            I'll go ahead and assign it to one of our MOPs team members and they will triage this issue and get back to you as soon as possible.
            But first let's keep working together to ensure that you have given us as much context as possible prior to their Triage.
            
            Give me a sec to finish the assignment and labeling of this issue and I will get back to you with next steps.
