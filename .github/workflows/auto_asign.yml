            @${{ github.event.issue.user.login }}, we will be using the `Nurture task list` to automatically open Task issues based off of this Master Batch Issue. :rocket:
            
            For that to work I'll need your help with two simple steps:
            
            **1 -** Please `Edit` the **Nurture task list** in the opening comment above by replacing `YOUR-REGION` with the region you are based in & `YOUR-CUSTOM-TITLE` with a title of your preference.
            
                
            **2 -** Once you are done adding `Region` and `Custom title` to your tasks go ahead and convert them to an issue by hovering over each task and clicking in the upper-right corner of the task.
            
            That is all! I will be reaching out to you in each task issue... See you later :partying_face:

            Single Emails are straight forward and I believe we already have all that is needed to work on it for you. 
            
            In case of any additional questions someone from the team will get in touch.

            If these are leads from a Webinar that we worked on together, we would ask you to go to that issue and follow the instructions there. 
            
            If this Lead Upload doesn't come from a Webinar that we worked on together you are in the right place and we will pick it up from here :smile:
