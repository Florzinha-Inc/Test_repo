            ðŸ‘‹ @{{ author }}, this is the MOPs bot. Thank you for raising an issue!
            I'll go ahead and assign it to one of our MOPs team members and they will triage this issue and get back to you as soon as possible.
            But first let's keep working together to ensure that you have given us as much context as possible prior to their Triage.
            
            Give me a sec to finish the assignment and labeling of this issue and I will get back to you with next steps.

            For all Webinars we usually follow the following structure:
            **1 -** Subscription Landing Page -> When ready please run `/landing-page` to start building this asset
            **2 -** Emails (invite, follow-up, thank-you) -> When ready please run `/create-email` as many times as needed to build all necessary emails 
            **3 -** Thank you page -> When ready please run `/thank-you-page` to start building this asset
            **4 -** Lead upload -> When ready please run `/lead-upload` to give us the necessary information
            
            **Remember:** One at a time all `/commands` listed above need to be typed on a comment box like the one below :point_down:

            Single Emails are straight forward and I believe we already have all that is needed to work on it for you. 
            
            In case of any additional questions someone from the team will get in touch.

            If these are leads from a Webinar that we worked on together, we would ask you to go to that issue and follow the instructions there. 
            
            If this Lead Upload doesn't come from a Webinar that we worked on together you are in the right place and we will pick it up from here :smile:

            We take Bug Reports very seriously and I've already added our entire team to look at this.
            
            In case this is more like a question and not really a bug please open a AMA issue instead and we will be happy to help you out.
            
            Thank you!
