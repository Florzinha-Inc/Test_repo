            @${{ github.event.issue.user.login }}, thank you for opening this Master issue for your new Nurture. I see that you've given us most of the required information for a successful Nurture. 
            
            Please go ahead and convert the task in the *Task list for sub-issues* above to an issue. We will be working together on assets creation in the Task issue and leave this Master Issue just for the required initial information.
            
            I will reach back to you in the Task issue. See you!

            If these are leads from a Webinar that we worked on together, we would ask you to go to that issue and follow the instructions there. 
            
            If this Lead Upload doesn't come from a Webinar that we worked on together you are in the right place and we will pick it up from here :smile:

            @${{ github.event.issue.user.login }}, we will be using the `Webinar task list` to automatically open Task issues based off of this Master Batch Issue. :rocket:
            
            For that to work I'll need your help with two simple steps:
            
            **1 -** Please `Edit` the **Webinar task list** in the opening comment above by replacing `YOUR-REGION` with the region you are based in & `YOUR-CUSTOM-TITLE` with a title of your preference.
            
                
            **2 -** Once you are done adding `Region` and `Custom title` to your tasks go ahead and convert them to an issue by hovering over each task and clicking in the upper-right corner of the task.
            
            That is all! I will be reaching out to you in each task issue... See you later :partying_face:
