            @{{ author }}, please type the command "/campaign-email" to start giving us the details for the email build.
            **Pro-tip:** Type it as many times as necessary according to the number of emails required for this campaign**
            Please type the command otherwise it won't work. Yep, copy and past won't do it unfortunately.
