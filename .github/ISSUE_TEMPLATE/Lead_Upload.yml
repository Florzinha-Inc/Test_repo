        Hey there, I am the MOPs bot! In this repo we use ChatOps to streamline our communication and run development and operations functions. Because of that you will see me around a lot! Don't be a stranger :wink:
        
        Please go ahead and fill out the basic information needed for a Lead Upload below then hit `Submit new issue` and I'll be back with next steps.
        
        One last tip before I let you go... Even though we will be linking you to examples of how to format the lead upload document like a pro, here are the fields you must have in your doc (they can't be blank):
        **1. First Name**
        **2. Last Name**
        **3. Company Name**
        **4. Email address**
        **5. Last SFDC Campaign ID**
        **6. Last SFDC Campaign status**
