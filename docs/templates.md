# Resizing images:

* Upload the picture by drag-and-drop in the text field
* replace `![image](https://your-image-url.type)` with `<img src="https://your-image-url.type" width="100" height="100">`

It's not mandatory to set both `width` and `height`. If only one is set, the other will be adjusted accordingly to preserve the aspect ratio of the image.

# Centralized CTAs:

* We use a blend of HTML and Markdown for this and you can change the value of `align=` to either `right`, `left`, or `center`.

In the past year since shutting down Pull Reminders and Pull Assigners in favor of [code review assignment](https://help.github.com/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/managing-code-review-assignment-for-your-team?elqTrackId=002db819dbf5442bb22443a5a237bb00) and [scheduled reminders](https://help.github.com/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/managing-scheduled-reminders-for-your-team?elqTrackId=875d7ea4e81544778cbad48e18790be7), we have seen a significant decrease in the usage of the remaining Pull Analytics features. As a result, we are considering shutting down the Pull Panda and Pull Analytics services.

As one of our most active customers, we would like to get your input on our plans. Please reply to this email or contact myteam@github.com if you have any questions or concerns.
